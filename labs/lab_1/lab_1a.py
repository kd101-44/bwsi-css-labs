I was part of the JHU EEI summer program last year, and I currently participate in FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge). I'm a founder of my school's engineering club, where we work on STEM projects (like building pasta trusses) and tutor middle schoolers on STEM topics. I enjoy hearing about new cultures, and I love learning math, physics, and chemistry! In my spare time, I simrace, catch up on Formula 1, or binge-watch my favorite series, Dark!")
